# Who are we?

The only requirement to be part of Coffeekraken is to love coffee and krakens. If you know how to develop in html, javascript (nodejs, etc...), css (sass, etc...), it's good as well.

More seriously, we are a young collectve of front-end creative developers with a goal in mind. Build tools to make every team working day life better.
This is our first and only concern and all our tools are build around that purpose.
