#Â Typography

- Default typography styles (only if needed)
- Nice mixins to handle typography properties
	- ```@include s-font(quote italic bold underline)``` to quickly apply text styles
	- ```@include s-vertical-rhythme()``` To handle vertical spaces
	- and more...
- Provide helper classes like ```.t-left```, ```.t-right```, ```.t-uppercase```, ```.t-lowercase```, and many more...
