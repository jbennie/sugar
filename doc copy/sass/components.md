# Components

- Give you access to pre-build customizable components
- Each components are divided in two parts
 	1. The **bare** part that gives you only the structure of the component (sizes, paddings, etc...)
	2. The **style** part that gives you a pre-build style if you don't want to make your own
- Here's a list of components that are available with the toolkit:
	- Buttons (basic / outline / link / etc...)
	- Corner badges
	- Dropdowns (dropup / right aligned / etc...)
	- Form (inputs / textarea / select / addon / groups / etc...)
	- Navigations (inline / tabs / justify / etc...)
	- Tables (basic / striped / hover / bordered / etc...)
	- Typography (titles / paragraphs / lists / inline elements / quotes / etc...)
