# debounce

This utils function allows you to make sure that a function that will normally be called
several times, for example during a scroll event, to be called only once after
the delay passed


### Example
```js
	const myDebouncedFn = debounce(() => {
		// my function content that will be
		// executed only once after the 1 second delay
}, 1000);

document.addEventListener('scroll', (e) => {
		// call my debounced function
		myDebouncedFn();
});
```
